# image-combiner

This project allows a user to input two images and create a side-by-side composite image, either in horizontal or vertical orientation.  
Such functionality is useful in various scenarios such as when one needs to create a "before and after" image using two component images.

Currently I'm using [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick) wrappers to handle the required image manipulations.
