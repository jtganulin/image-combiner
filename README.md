# image-combiner

This project allows a user to input two images and create a side-by-side composite image, either in horizontal or vertical orientation.  
Such functionality is useful in various scenarios such as when one needs to create a "before and after" image using two component images.

In an effort to review certain technologies as well as improve my skills with new platforms, I'd like to create multiple versions of this project,  
using differnt tools such as VS C# and WinForms, WPF, Python with Tk, JavaFX, and a PHP web-app, to name a few.

Currently I'm using [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick) wrappers to handle the required image manipulations.
